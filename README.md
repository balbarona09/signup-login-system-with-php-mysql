<h1>Signup and Login System with PHP and MySQL</h1>
<h2>How does our signup and login system works</h2>
First, we have our homepage (index.php). On our homepage, we will show a login button if the user is not logged in; otherwise, we will show our homepage content, which, for the sake of this tutorial, will only output their name, email, and a logout button that will enable them to logout.

Then, when the login button from the homepage is clicked, it will proceed to the login page (login.php), where the user can login. A user can login using their email and password.

Finally, if the user doesn't have an account yet, he or she can create one on the signup page (signup.php). A user can access the signup page by clicking the signup link on the login page. The user will have to input his or her name, email, and password twice.
